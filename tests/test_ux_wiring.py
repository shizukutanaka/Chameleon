"""Covers ux_improvements.py wiring into main.py's AudioProcessor.batch_process.

ux_improvements.py was previously packaged but never imported (CHARTER §9's
orphaned-module punch list). It is stdlib-only, real, and non-duplicative, so
it was wired in rather than deleted: batch_process gained an opt-in
show_progress flag that renders a ProgressBar, and the CLI's batch command
colorizes its summary line with ColorText.
