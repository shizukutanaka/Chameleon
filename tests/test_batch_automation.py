"""The batch_automation engine is an allowed orphan, but it still has to
do what it claims. Two of its public paths could never have worked:

* `WorkflowBuilder`'s 'builtin' function type resolved an allowlisted
  callable and handed it straight to an executor that invokes
  `function(**inputs)` -- every allowlisted function (len, math.pow,
  statistics.mean, ...) is positional-only, so every task ended
  TaskStatus.FAILED with 'takes no keyword arguments'.
* `BatchScheduler.schedule_workflow` recognized 'daily', 'hourly' and
  'every_<minutes>' but fell through to `pass` for anything else -- the
  job was then registered in scheduled_jobs and never ran.
